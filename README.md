# Customer-Churn-Analysis

# Situation:
    Businesses often struggle with understanding why customers leave (churn).
    Identifying trends and patterns related to churn can help businesses make better decisions and take proactive actions. 
    This project aims to create a visual dashboard to help businesses track customer churn effectively.

# Task:
    The goal of this project was to create an interactive dashboard that displays key metrics and insights about customer churn. 
    This dashboard will allow businesses to quickly understand customer behavior and identify areas that need attention.

# Action:
    Data Exploration: The dataset was cleaned and explored to identify important factors influencing churn (e.g., tenure, contract type, customer service calls).
    Visualization: Key insights were visualized using charts, graphs, and KPIs, making it easier for business leaders to interpret the data at a glance.
    Dashboard Creation: Using tools like Power BI or Tableau, an interactive dashboard was built where users can filter the data by different factors (e.g., region, contract type) and view churn patterns.
    User Experience: Ensured the dashboard is user-friendly, with clear visuals and easy navigation to help decision-makers understand the data quickly.
    
# Result:
The dashboard provides clear insights into customer churn, helping businesses identify at-risk customers and trends. 
With this tool, businesses can make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention and reduce churn.
